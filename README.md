# PodsToProfits
PodsToProfit is a educational game designed with the goal of educating players on the real-life cycle and workflow of soybean farmers.

Players can learn to make decisions and understand the consequences of those decisions when it comes to Organic vs Non-organic farming.

Using data that comes from actual historical examples, we are able to emulate events that farmers encounter in the real world, and the player
has to react in an effective way to manage these.

This game forces the player to make good decisions that impact them in the future, and they learn how farming is done in the real-world!
